# CASSINI Hackathons - EU Space for Security and Defence
## Enhancing Defence & Security with Geospatial Intelligence

## Overview

Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) is critical in ensuring data authenticity and safeguarding capabilities against cyber threats. Beyond analyzing imagery and geospatial data, it addresses vulnerabilities in **Earth Observation (EO)** systems, such as data collection, processing, and cybersecurity.

GEOINT integrates disciplines like mapping, imagery analysis, and intelligence, with applications in defence, telecommunications, transportation, public safety, and more. Its impact enhances disaster response, security operations, and everyday life.

## Challenge

Participants are invited to leverage European space data from **Copernicus**, **Galileo**, and upcoming **IRIS2** services to develop innovative products for planners, responders, and decision-makers.

### Focus Areas

1. **GEOINT for Defence & Security**  
   - Disaster relief and resource optimization  
   - Threat prediction and response  
   - Applications in border control, counter-terrorism, illegal activities, and surveillance  

2. **Innovative GEOINT Services**  
   - Propose new **Copernicus** services for security, emergency management, and infrastructure monitoring.

3. **Cybersecurity for Remote Sensing**  
   - Assess and address vulnerabilities in EO systems to improve cyber resilience.

4. **Authentication of EO Data**  
   - Validate EO data using historical patterns and technologies like **blockchain** for tamper-proof records.
